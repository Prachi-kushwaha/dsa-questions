# Recursion & Backtracking

This folder contains problems that use recursion and backtracking to explore
all possible combinations or configurations.

## Core Concepts
- Decision tree recursion
- Take / Not Take pattern
- Constraint-based pruning
- Backtracking (state restoration)

## When to Use Backtracking
- When exploring multiple choices
- When constraints limit valid paths

## Common Template
```cpp
choose
recurse
un-choose (backtrack)
